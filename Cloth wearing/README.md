# Prototype based on MacOS

#### Duing to missing necessary libraries on IOS, this prototype is based on MacOS.

#### In this prototype:
1. Consider human body as a cylinder and only consider body part(i.e. Ignore arms/legs/head).
2. Only consider cloth on body part(e.g. shirt).
3. Only consider body optimum temperature.
4. Ignore age/gender.
5. Ignore humidity/wind speed/weather.
